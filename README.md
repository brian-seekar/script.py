### sshots: Screenshot Sorter
- to keep spirits reasonably high after KIVA i decided to build something for myself. during a botathon (RAG_SHE) i found the os module interesting; it could apparently interact with files on your system. of course i used pathlib for this (mini)project because i'm trying to make sense of OOP.
- i added the dictionary to replace month numbers with their respective month names. that's v2.

- a document sorting script will likely follow. using either book titles (or/and a dictionary with author and subject pairs) to categorize my 'e-library' backlog.

recommendations on things you'd like to have/see are welcome.
